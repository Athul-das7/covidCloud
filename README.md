## Basic Guide lines:

- The final project will be present in the `main` folder.
- All the test code or practise code must be written in `test` folder.
- In `test` @athul or @mounika are to write their test code in the folder inside their folder and they can arrange it in the best way the see fit.
- While doing the commit make sure to put a relevant message so that we can know what has been newly changed or added for example;
